# Background

## Using Herbie Module to extract the data from a gridded forecast file

This script uses the Python module Herbie to extract the data from a
gridded forecast file at a specific location. See [Herbie
documentation](https://herbie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for additional
info. The Herbie module is a Python library that provides a simple
interface to access gridded forecast data from various sources. It can
be used to extract data from a variety of forecast models, including
GFS, ECMWF, and ICON.

I initally coded this up in a Python Notebook to test functionality. See
`get_forecasts/Herbie_Extract_GEFS_Point.ipynb` for that walk through.

## Create/Activate Conda Environment for Herbie Extracion

Best to use this script with a python environment, so we'll make that
using a helper script `herbie_py_setup.R`, which installs herbie and any
additional necessary modules.

```{r}
library(reticulate)

source('get_forecasts/herbie_py_setup.R')
```

## Load modules

And now, load all the modules needed for this script.

```{python}
from herbie import Herbie
from metpy.units import units
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from herbie.toolbox import EasyMap, pc, ccrs
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import xarray as xr
import itertools
```

## Store objects and functions

And store the objects and functions needed

```{python}
# saving the location for weather that we want - in this case Shadow Mountain 
# Reservoir
point = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({"longitude": [-105.85], "latitude": [40.22], "stid": ["smr"]}, orient="columns")

# and store the function to grab Herbie data from a specific point
def get_data(df, point):
    extracted = df.herbie.pick_points(points = point, method = "nearest")
    return extracted.to_dataframe()

# list the members we care about (all of them)
member_list  = ("c00", "p01", "p02", "p03", "p04", "p05", "p06",
  "p07", "p08", "p09", "p10", "p11", "p12", "p13", 
  "p14", "p15", "p16", "p17", "p18", "p19", "p20",
  "p21", "p22", "p23", "p24", "p25", "p26", "p27",
  "p28", "p29", "p30")

# list the forecast intervals we care about (time 0 as well as noon-local for 7 days)
fxx_list = (0, 12, 36, 60, 84, 108, 132, 156)#, 180, 204, 228)

# create the function to get the data we need using herbie
def get_gefs(date, member, fxx):
    dt = str(date + " 06:00") # 6UTC is approximately midnight here
    H = Herbie(dt, model='gefs', product="atmos.25", member = member, fxx = fxx)
    ds = H.xarray("TMP|[U|V]GRD|GUST|TMAX|TMIN|D[S|L]WRF")
    result = [get_data(df, point) for df in ds]
    result = pd.concat(result, axis=1)
    # Get the column names
    cols = result.columns
    # Create a boolean mask for columns to keep
    mask = ~cols.duplicated(keep='first')
    # Use the mask to select only non-duplicated columns
    result = result.loc[:, mask]
    return result

```

## Loop through dates

And now pull it all together, we'll do this by for-loop in case we need
to restart at any point due to the length of time this takes (\~20m for
each day of data).

```{python}
start_date = "2022-05-01"
end_date = "2022-11-01"
date_list = pd.date_range(start_date, end_date)
# convert to string
DATESEQUENCE = [date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for date in date_list]

for date in DATESEQUENCE:
  print("Beggining extraction of forecasts for "+date)
  results = []
  for member, fxx in itertools.product(member_list, fxx_list):
      results.append(get_gefs(date, member, fxx))
  # Combine all results into a single DataFrame
  final_result = pd.concat(results, keys=[(m, f) for m, f in itertools.product(member_list, fxx_list)])
  # write dataframe
  final_result.to_csv(("data/herbie_extraction/GEFS_p25_"+date+".csv"), index=False)

```

And for 2023

```{python}
start_date = "2023-05-01"
end_date = "2023-11-01"
date_list = pd.date_range(start_date, end_date)
# convert to string
DATESEQUENCE = [date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for date in date_list]

for date in DATESEQUENCE:
  print("Beggining extraction of forecasts for "+date)
  results = []
  for member, fxx in itertools.product(member_list, fxx_list):
      results.append(get_gefs(date, member, fxx))
  # Combine all results into a single DataFrame
  final_result = pd.concat(results, keys=[(m, f) for m, f in itertools.product(member_list, fxx_list)])
  # write dataframe
  final_result.to_csv(("data/herbie_extraction/GEFS_p25_"+date+".csv"), index=False)

```
